# Statistical Methods for Data Science
This project aims to develop a predictive model that provides a reliable utilization forecast to update nursing facilities' Medicaid funding rate schedule.

# Brief Introduction
The State of Wisconsin Medicaid program funds nursing home care for individuals
qualifying based on need and financial status. As part of the conditions for
participation, Medicaid-certified nursing homes must file an annual cost report,
summarizing the volume and cost of care provided to all of its residents, Medicaid-funded and otherwise. 
These cost reports are audited and form the basis for
facility-specific Medicaid daily payment rates for subsequent periods.
# Data
The data here is in the cost report years 2000 and 2001. There were 362 facilities
in 2000 and 355 facilities in 2001. Typically, utilization of nursing home care is
measured in patient days (“patient days” is the number of days each patient was
in the facility, summed over all patients).
